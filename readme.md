## About the project

This app is built during the hackathon Trainhack 2018 to make it easier to get compensation for late busses and metros. Today most people don't even know that you can get some money back when SL's busses and trains are late. This is also usually really annyoing to fill in and it takes a lot of time. With this project the goal is to make a better and easier way for people to get compensation.
